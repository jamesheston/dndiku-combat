# Ranvier MUD Engine Bundle - dndiku-combat

This is an optional replacement for the ranvier-combat bundle that adds a dice-roll-based combat inspired by the CircleMUDs and tabletop games I grew up playing.

It is 1 of a set of bundles required to enable this behavior:
* dndiku-combat
* dndiku-equipment
* dndiku-classes
